# HTML Documentation
The HTML file begins with the standard head section where the title of the web page is defined. It also includes links to external resources, such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript libraries. In this case, it references Font Awesome for icons and Bootstrap for styling. The header also introduces the main navigation bar that allows users to easily access different functionalities.

### Main Content

1. **Header and Navigation**: The primary content area is divided into two main sections - the left side and the right side. The left side is dedicated to file upload and display functionalities, while the right side contains information about the tool, including features, logging, and various toggles for pandas operations.

2. **File Upload and Display**: The left side of the content area focuses on facilitating file upload and displaying the contents of the uploaded file. Users can upload CSV or Excel files, and the displayed area dynamically updates to show the uploaded data.

3. **Tool Information and Features**: The right side provides information about the tool, such as the name ("Pandas Helper"), a tagline, and a list of features represented by Font Awesome icons. This section aims to give users a quick overview of what the tool can offer.

4. **Logging Section**: There is a dedicated area for logging, where users can view logs of their actions. The "Show Logs" button triggers the display of a textarea containing the logs.

5. **Pandas Operations Toggles**: A set of toggles represents different pandas operations like showing original and current data frames, using functions like `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, etc. Each toggle is associated with specific pandas functionality and is intended to provide a user-friendly way to interact with pandas operations.

### Modals

Modals are used to group related functionalities under different categories. These categories include Data Output, Data Manipulation, Data View, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization. Modals provide a clean and organized way to present a set of operations, reducing clutter on the main page.

### Footer

The footer is a standard fixed-bottom element that includes a copyright notice. This provides information about the tool's author or owner, in this case, "Nikunj Mistry."

### Scripts

The script section includes references to external libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap, as well as custom JavaScript files responsible for handling specific functionalities of the web application. Additionally, the tool utilizes the xlsx library for working with Excel files.
